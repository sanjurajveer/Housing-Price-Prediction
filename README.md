üõ†Ô∏è Features and Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values using appropriate imputation strategies.
Encoded categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.
Scaled numerical features to standardize data (used StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler).
2. Feature Engineering
Selected relevant features based on correlation and domain knowledge.
Handled skewness in numerical features for better model performance.
Created new features (if applicable) to enrich the dataset.
3. Model Training
Utilized the XGBoost Regressor, a gradient boosting algorithm, for accurate predictions.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search and Cross-Validation for optimal results.
4. Performance Metrics
The XGBoost model achieved the following scores:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.2241
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.3071
R¬≤ Score: 0.8806
These results demonstrate the model's high accuracy in predicting housing prices.
